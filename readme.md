# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic. Given passenger data, we explore the dataset, preprocess it, build a prediction model, and evaluate its accuracy.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic in the data science world. It includes information about passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status. Our goal is to predict survival using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We start with a detailed analysis of the dataset, creating visualizations to uncover insights and relationships among variables.

- **Data Preprocessing:** We clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data to prepare it for modeling.

- **Model Building:** We utilize a Random Forest Classifier to create our prediction model. Hyperparameter tuning may be applied for optimization.

- **Model Evaluation:** We assess the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics to gauge its predictive performance.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib).
3. Open and execute the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform EDA, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Results

Our model achieved an accuracy score of 93.38% on the test dataset, demonstrating its capability to predict Titanic passenger survival.

## Future Work

- Further fine-tuning of hyperparameters and model optimization.
- Deployment of the model for real-time predictions.
- Exploration of additional features and data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.
